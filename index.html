                    <p>Have you ever heard someone say that programming is for men, and that women are not suited for
                        it? Or have you just had a vague feeling that coding or tech is not an area where you would fit in or something
                        you could be good at? Let us tell you sister, that these assumptions and feelings are common but they have no true substance at all.
                        In fact, throughout history there has been a number of women who has played crucial parts in the
                        development of coding and tech as we know it today. So let us enlighten you about some of the amazing women that has
                        helped make programming and tech whatit is today – look, read an be inspired! </p>

                                        not only did she create a very complex program for finding ”Bernoulli’s number”

                                        that still underpins much of the internets functionality and networking science.

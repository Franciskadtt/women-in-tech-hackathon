Our Team took part in a Code Institute Hackathon where we had to design and executed a coding project in a team. We were four team members that had to work together to build a project based on an assigned theme: Empower and enable Women and Girls to Thrive in the world of coding. We build a website to inspire and empower young girls (age 9-12) to learn about the world of coding through a mentor program, a quiz, a role model section and some extra resources.

The team members for this project was: Teema Namdarian, Mario Gusman, Isabelle Ängsås, and Franciska Du Toit under the guidance of our mentor, Tim Nelson.
